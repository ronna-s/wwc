* Hello World!
Yes, we can even display and run code with this thing!
.play main.go

* Shall we have a look at the language?

* WARNING!

- The coding examples I picked for this talk are not the simplest!
- You don't have to understand everything, they are meant to pique your interest...

* Starting an HTTP server is easy...

.play http.go
.link http://127.0.0.1:8080/hi

* Interfaces implementation is implicit (and other tricks...)

.play interfaces.go /START/,/DONE/

* Goroutines #1 (Spawn and Wait)
Goroutine â‰  Thread

- Threads setup, teardown and context switches are heavy (and slow)...
- The # of physical threads is limited. No point in creating more threads than physical.
- The Go scheduler creates threads (NOT a pool) to run Goroutines.
.play goroutines1.go /START/,/DONE/

* Goroutines #2 (Communicate via Channels)

- Channels are message queues that are safe for concurrency.
.play goroutines2.go /START/,/DONE/

* Errors are values
There are no exceptions in Go, the concept of hierarchy between errors is prone to errors.
.play errors.go /START/,/DONE/

* State of Diversity

* Women Who Go
- Women Who Go is a global organization dedicated to increase the diversity of the Go community.

* Our Workshops
- We offer (almost) monthly workshops in Go on various topics aimed to improve your Go skills and your programming skills in general.
- Safe space is, of course, part of the deal.
- Bravery is encouraged. Speak about anything you did with Go and get a pink gopher plush.

* The biGOpportunity!
- There are estimated 2M gophers worldwide, an increase of 100% from last year.
- Our aim is to build this community properly from the start.

* Go crazy!
- There are jobs in Berlin for gophers!
- I also recommend joining:
